        </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <p>So,coming to story, the name of the novels explains, it's on one Indian girl, Radhika during her journey, she meets 3 guys.</p></li>
                <li> <p> <b>Debashish Sen (Debu)(First Boy Friend)</b>, a pretentious feminist single good-looking advertising guy who at their first meeting makes radhika feel that girls should be promoted and all feminism crap (just to impress her) which later-on was discovered that he didn’t mean any of it (he was unable to accept that his girlfriend earned a lot more than he did). This created a hole in his mind, raised some issues between them and despite great sex,love,romance they brokeup.As a consequence of this break-up, radhika left New york and got transferred to Hong kong department of Goldman Sachs. </p></li>
                
                <li> <p> <b> Second guy : Neel Gupta</b>, a married man in his mid 40’s, a senior partner at Goldman Sachs (Big Bucks) . Skipping the boring business stuff, Neel and radhika gets close during some business deals. Not going to deep into that, despite the age difference and the boss-employee relation, they have sex on an island and as per radhika, this was the best sex she ever had (well,technically speaking this was only her 2nd experience). Later-on, radhika meets Neel’s wife and his 2 children, and finds neel’s wife too good,decent,caring. This leads to the legendary sentence “This is Wrong”.
                Long-story short, Radhika’s life’s 2nd breakup happens and she leaves hong kong too and gets transferred to London Department of Goldman Sachs.</p></li>

                <li> <p><b>Third Guy : Brijesh Gulati</b>, a typical punjabi IT guy currently systems engineer at Facebook (Wealthy enough) for the last five years, did his masters from MIT in boston,USA. Well, throught her journey with Mr Gulati from Skype to first meet at a cafe in St Regis Hotel’s cafe, New York to their destination wedding at Goa . Well, Mr Gulati was a perfect Indian calm nice guy but also boring at times(He did sound a boring person from his name).He was all-together frank and open-minded </p></li>
                <li><p>
                  Destination Wedding Scenario : To add a bit of Chetan Bhagat suspense/thrill, both debu and neel arrived at the scene of wedding of brijesh and radhika, both of them with a motive to fly away radhika and marry her. This facade created a whirlwind of thoughts in radhika’s confused mind about whom to choose (Lucky girl Radhika i must say). Spending time with brijesh and the flashbacks of the both the relationships lead her somewhat to believe that brijesh was in-fact the perfect match but her mini-me didn’t had the guts to do so, hence confused radhika called debu and neel together to a cafe at 5 in the morning, introduced them, blah blah blah and lastly asked both of them to fuck off from her life (she literally did say “Fuck off”) and later-on said to brijesh that she cannot marry him. Apologizing to everyone and lots of family melodrama, the wedding got cancelled. (Brijesh did support her decision infront of his family inspite the fact he was not happy making him more lovable).
                </p></li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <b>The End :</b> To cut short, Radhika was on a world-tour and she on her way stopped to meet Brijesh, they had a good time and she was now totally convinced that he was indeed the perfect choice/match for her. Though the book doesn’t narrates the further life of radhika, it was pretty clear that she got married to Mr Gulati.
